# Guess Who Game

Second week with Javascript on the course. Week 5 assignment was to create a boardgame of the classical "Guess Who" game. 
We got all the characters in an array and starting code.  

## The problem

The hardest part was to connect all the functions to each other and figure out what kind of information the game needed next to be able to move forward in the structure. The keep function that keeps the characters in play if you guessed right and the setup for how to hide the last screen (You won/You lost) if player wants to restart the game where extra tricky. If I had more time I would haveadded some styling, used other characters and take a deep dive in the media queries for the drowpdown menu (Select).
